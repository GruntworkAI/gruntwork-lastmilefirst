## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

#### Three new Key Hire experts (roster grows 13 → 16)

- **Ripley the Rent Collector** (`ripley`) — Reviewer and Anti-Slop Specialist. Editorial quality, signal density, voice-preserving rewrite. Reviews README/CLAUDE.md/docs/PRD/prompt/AI-output for low-signal writing using the RENT framework (Relevance, Evidence, Newness, Traction). New skill `review-signal`, agent `consult-ripley`, command `/run-review-signal`. Fills the previously-uncovered gap between Shannon (context placement), Reese (source validation), and per-domain review skills.

- **McBain the Senior Partner (TMT)** (`mcbain`) — Pre-delivery review of TMT (tech/media/telecom) engagement materials. Reads decks/primers/reference files as a set; flags cross-artifact drift, version-discipline defects, sector-credibility tells (wrong FCC docket numbers, ARPU charts mixing service and equipment revenue, "5G" labels on LTE-A data, etc.), and engagement-shape gaps. New skill `review-deliverable`, agent `consult-mcbain`, command `/run-review-deliverable`. Sector-narrow by design; redirects non-TMT engagements to sector-appropriate experts.

- **Pam F the PMF Guru** (`pam`) — Product-market-fit discipline distilled from the YC seed-stage canon (Michael Seibel's pitch guide and product talk). Direct, blunt, allergic to founder-speak. Scores Frequency × Intensity × Willingness to Pay on a 1–4 scale; returns Real-PMF / Possible-PMF / No-PMF-yet verdict with one concrete actionable next step. New skill `review-pmf`, agent `consult-pam`, command `/run-review-pmf`.

#### Designed pairings

- **Ripley ↔ `review-claude`**: Ripley reads the prose; `review-claude` decides what belongs and where. Run `review-claude` first for structure, then Ripley for language.
- **McBain ↔ Pam F**: Same artifact, two reads. McBain reads how the board/counterparty sees it; Pam reads how the market sees it. Often opposite verdicts — the disagreement is the value.

#### `audit-plugin` skill and `/run-audit-plugin` command
Wrapper around [Griffith](https://github.com/GruntworkAI/gruntwork-griffith) for plugin evaluation. Shells out to `griffith analyze <source> --json`, parses the result, and renders a markdown summary in the Claude session.
  - Accepts git URLs, `owner/repo` GitHub shorthand, and local paths — supports both pre-install vetting and post-install re-audit
  - `--strict` flag passes through to enable broader (noisier) security rules
  - `--json` flag emits raw Griffith JSON for scripting / comparison
  - Auto-discovers `griffith` binary: PATH first, then `~/Code/gruntwork/gruntwork-griffith/.venv/bin/griffith` dev fallback; clear install instructions if neither
  - Escapes untrusted plugin content (names, paths, finding text) in code fences to prevent prompt injection into the surrounding Claude session
  - Validates `schema_version` before rendering; warns on unknown versions
  - Renders risk-level banner, inventory table, severity breakdown, footprint + efficiency rating, architecture pattern + recommendations, and findings detail grouped by severity (cap 10 per group)

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **`scan-secrets` pre-commit hook silently no-op'd for any rule containing regex escapes** — three reinforcing bugs combined so the hook printed "No secrets detected in staged changes" while gitleaks had aborted during config load. The pre-commit secret scan provided no real defense for an unknown period.
  - `format_loader.py` now serializes string values as TOML literal strings (`'''...'''`) instead of basic strings (`"""..."""`); basic strings interpret backslash sequences, which either hard-errored on `\+` or silently mangled `\s`/`\w` in regex values.
  - `format_loader.py` now serializes dict-value sub-tables (e.g. `[rules.allowlist]`) with their contents, emitted after the parent rule's scalars/lists (per TOML ordering invariant). Previously the dict's contents were dropped entirely, so three shipped rules (`lmf-hardcoded-password`, `lmf-bearer-token-hardcoded`, `lmf-jwt-secret`) lost their test-path allowlists.
  - `scanner.py` `scan_staged` and `scan_repo` now fail-closed when the requested `--report-path` file doesn't exist after gitleaks runs. Gitleaks uses exit code 1 ambiguously for both "leaks found" and "config load failure"; report-file existence is the reliable signal that the scan actually completed.
  - Smoke-tested end-to-end: good config + fixture `oc_p1_*` token → caught (exit 1); deliberately malformed config → fail-closed with stderr surfaced (exit 1).

### Changed
- Aligned version drift across `plugin.json` (was 0.14.0), `marketplace.json` (was 0.11.1), and `README.md` (was 0.10.1) — all now `0.14.1`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Per-Project/Per-Org Overwatch State Tracking** — Overwatch now tracks review, organize, and scan timestamps independently for each project and org, replacing the old single-global-timestamp model
  - State file upgraded to v2 format with `global`, `orgs`, and `projects` scopes
  - Lazy, automatic migration from v1 — no user action needed
  - `update_state.py` rewritten with `--scope` (project/org/global) and `--key` args, auto-detects current project from CWD
  - `update_state.py status` shows current project/org/global state; `--all` shows everything tracked
  - Session start alerts are now context-aware: show project name in messages, skip project-scoped alerts when at workspace root

- **CLAUDE.md Review Tracking** — new `last_review_claude` field tracked at all three levels (user, org, project) with 30-day staleness threshold

- **Skill Overwatch Integration** — `review-project`, `organize-project`, `review-claude`, and `organize-orgs` skills now include an "Update Overwatch" step so state gets recorded after each run

### Changed
- `scan-secrets` now records `last_secret_scan` per-project instead of globally
- `session_start.py` resolves current org/project context before generating alerts
- `overwatch.py` exports new functions: `resolve_context()`, `get_scoped_state()`, `update_scoped_state()`, `update_project_state()`, `update_org_state()`
- `update_state_field()` preserved for backward compatibility (operates on global scope)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Secret Scanning** - `/run-scan-secrets` for detecting secrets and credentials
  - Full git history scanning via gitleaks with custom format rules
  - `--all` mode scans entire workspace (all repos under ~/Code/)
  - `--audit` mode checks .gitignore gaps, dangerous committed files, repo visibility
  - `--audit --github` inventories all public repos across GitHub account and orgs
  - `--install-hooks` / `--uninstall-hooks` for global pre-commit hook via `core.hooksPath`
  - `--add-format` interactive flow for org-specific secret patterns
  - `--list-formats` / `--update-formats` for format library management
  - Two-tier format library: common (plugin-shipped) + org (user-managed) in `~/.claude/lastmilefirst/secret-formats/`
  - 16 custom gitleaks rules covering DB connection strings, env vars, terraform, hardcoded creds, webhooks, keys, JWT
  - All output redacted by default to prevent secondary leaks

- **Public Repo Awareness** - woven throughout the plugin
  - Every scan checks repo visibility; public repos get warning banner + severity bump
  - Pre-commit hook reminds on every commit to a public repo
  - Overwatch session start alerts when working in a public repo
  - GitHub account audit flags repos with suspicious names (internal, private, secret, config)

- **Overwatch Integration**
  - `check_secret_scan_status()` — alerts if never scanned or 7+ days stale
  - `check_repo_visibility()` — alerts when working in a public repo
  - `last_secret_scan` field in overwatch state
